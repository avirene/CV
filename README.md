## About Me

I have experience in education, linguistics and IT. I worked for a big IT company (EPAM Systems) for 10 years: as a Training and Education Manager and an IT Business Analyst. I have a strong interest in computational linguistics and software development, in particular educational software, speech recognition, and more.

## Skills

I am good at getting to the bottom of matters and then explaining them in a simple way. I always pay attention to detail and organise things and establish processes well. I constantly look for innovation and development. Due to my well-developed time-management skills, I am able to achieve my aims quickly and efficiently.

#### IT Business Analysis

I know what a Software Development Project is like in a big company. As a Business Analyst I was creating and updating project documentation for examination software (Microsoft Office skills). I was also working with the test team to enable them to develop a system test plan. I can work with such tools as Microsoft Office, Power Point, Visio, Sparx EnterpriseArchitect, XML, UML, Jira, Confluence, SVN, Paint.NET, Adobe Photoshop, Slack, GitHub. The project combined the Waterfall and Agile methodologies.

#### Strong Analytical Skills and Desire for Innovation

As a linguist and a teacher, I have deep understanding of language structure in terms of morphology, syntax and semantics, as I had to explain it to my IT students who never cross the stream where it's shallowest but take the road less travelled.

As a teacher I have always been good at writing rules of grammar and collocation in a simple yet structured way using presentations, infographics, charts and memory cards. I was also the first English teacher in the company to teach English courses as webinars back in 2010.
