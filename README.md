## About Me

I have experience in IT, education, and linguistics. Since school, I have always had a strong interest in tech, in particular natural language processing, educational software, speech recognition, and more. But my initial career choice was influenced by the conventionally planted idea of a "more flexible" job in education which would allow a woman to combine a job and a family. However, I have always kept an eye on tech. I worked for a big IT company (<a href="https://www.epam.com/" target="_blank">EPAM Systems Ltd.</a>) for 10 years as a Training and Education Manager and an IT Business Analyst trying to get as close to software development as I possibly could. Finally, I decided to treat my interest in coding with proper attention and enrolled at the Makers Academy. I have just done their software development bootcamp and am really looking forward to my next position as a software engineer. In fact, since I completed the course, I have been experiencing constant urges to develop software for almost everything I daily deal with, which I satisfy by working on several projects.

## Transferable Skills

I am good at asking questions, getting to the bottom of matters and then explaining them in a simple way. I always pay attention to detail and organise things and establish processes well. I constantly look for innovation and development. Due to my solid time-management skills, I am able to achieve my aims quickly and efficiently.

#### Problem Solving

As a Software Developer, I am keen on writing applications that tackle practical issues users face. At the moment I am working on an application that helps language learners memorise vocabulary via automated elicitation of new words and collocations.

As an IT Business Analyst, I unified the project terminology used by the team, created a knowledge sharing base and use case templates which facilitated the communication within the team and sped up the process of use case writing.

As a Training and Education Manager, I promoted and developed e-learning in the company, created a bespoke Business English and cross-cultural awareness curriculum and improved the system of quality assurance in teaching and monitoring students’ progress, which led to a more flexibile, personalised and efficient system of learners' journeys.


#### Strong Analytical Skills

As a Software Developer, I ask questions that help me see a bigger picture of an application as early as possible in order to structure classes and methods clearly.

As a Business Analyst, I elicited customers' requirements by interviewing, clarifying and paraphrasing. I analysed this data and created structured specifications, models and diagrams. We switched between Waterfall and Agile methodologies depending on the project needs.

As a linguist and a teacher, I have deep understanding of language structure in terms of morphology, syntax and semantics. I have always been good at writing rules of grammar and collocation in a simple yet structured way using presentations, infographics, charts and memory cards. 

####  Desire for Innovation

Throughout my whole career I have been learning and developing. I did several teacher training courses, I designed tailor-made courses for the company. I was also the first English teacher in the company to teach English courses as webinars back in 2010.

I learned Business Analysis and I learned Software Development.
